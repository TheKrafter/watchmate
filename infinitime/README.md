# InfiniTime Companion Crate

Full-featured InfiniTime companion library for Rust. It provides Rust wrapper for InfiniTime BLE API, and various other helpers (such as GATT services, optional Freedesktop integration for media players and notifications, and helpers for downloading firmware releases from Github).

The plan is to polish the API, debloat dependencies, and then move it to a separate repo and publish on [crates.io](https://crates.io). **Note:** the license of the crate will likely be changed to MIT.
